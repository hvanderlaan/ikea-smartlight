# ikea-smartlight
python framework for controlling the Ikea smart lights (tradfri)

### update
as of gateway version 1.1.15 the usage of securityid is prohibated, you need to register a api user and you will get a pre shared key from the gateway. follow the steps below and all should be well
```bash
coap-client -m post -u "Client_identity" -k "SECURITY_CODE" -e '{"9090":"IDENTITY"}' "coaps://IP_ADDRESS:5684/15011/9063"
# SECURITY_CODE = the security code under the gateway
# IDENTITY      = your api user
```
when this is done create a file called tradfri.cfg and add
```ini
[tradfri]
hubip = x.x.x.x
apiuser = username
apipsk = pre shared key
```

### requirements
at this moment there is no coap libs with dTLS, the ikea smart lights are using dTLS with coap for security. the only option is to build a new libcoap with dTLS included. libcoap requires `cunit, a2x, doxygen and dot` you need to install these requirements first.

```bash
sudo apt-get install automake libtool
git clone --depth 1 --recursive -b dtls https://github.com/home-assistant/libcoap.git
cd libcoap
./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-documentation --disable-shared --without-debug CFLAGS="-D COAP_DEBUG_FD=stderr"
make
sudo make install
```

the framework also requires `tqdm` for showing progressbars, you could strip it from the sourcecode or install the module for python: `pip install pip --upgrade && pip install tqdm`.

### libcoap usage
```bash
# getting tradfri information
./coap-client -m get -u "Client_identity" -k "<key>" "coaps://<hup>:5684/15001"
# getting tradfri lightbulb status
./coap-client -m get -u "Client_identity" -k "<key>" "coaps://<hup>:5684/15001/65537"

# turn on tradfri lightbulb
./coap-client -m put -u "Client_identity" -k "<key>" -e '{ "3311" : [{ "5850" : 1 ]} }' "coaps://<hup>:5684/15001/65537"
# turn off tradfri lightbulb
./coap-client -m put -u "Client_identity" -k "<key>" -e '{ "3311" : [{ "5850" : 0 ]} }' "coaps://<hup>:5684/15001/65537"
```

### output
